<h3>Certifications:</h3>
<p><strong>iaedp Approved Supervisor</strong><br />
Professionals pursuing the CEDRD designation are required to be supervised by a qualified professional who has received approval from iaedp™’s Certification Committee. Since iaedp™ has designed its certification program to insure its certified members can demonstrate expertise through a range of professional activities, achievements, and supervised activities, requirements for supervision are designed to be in line with these same
competencies. It is iaedp™’s view that those who are providing supervision to Certification candidates must confirm their own extensive experience and training in the field of eating
disorders by application, which is reviewed and approved by the Certification Committee. (2015)

<p>An Approved Supervisor is defined as a professional who is not one’s primary personal dietitian; has a minimum of five (5) years experience treating persons with eating disorders; no fewer than 6,000 hours of approved work experience in the treatment and diagnosis of eating
disorders; accredited bachelor’s degree with internship or master’s degree or higher for Registered Dietitians.</p>

<p><strong><a name="cedrd" id="cedrd"></a>Certified Eating Disorders Registered Dietitian (CEDRD)</strong><br />
    The International Association of Eating Disorder Professionals (iaedp™) established the certification process to promote standards of excellence within the field of eating disorders. Individuals with the Certified Eating Disorders Registered Dietitian (CEDRD) certifications are health care professionals who have met rigorous educational requirements, have accumulated the requisite hours of qualifying work experience, have successfully passed a written examination covering the eating disorders field, have made a commitment to stay abreast of current developments in the field through Continuing Education, and have agreed to comply with the Association's Ethical Principles. (2011)

</p>

<p><strong>Certified Intuitive Eating Counselor</strong><br />
   
Intuitive eating is an approach that teaches how to create a healthy relationship with food, mind, and body to ultimately become the expert of your own body and distinguish between physical and emotional feelings.  It is a process of making peace with food to gain a sense of body wisdom so that you no longer have constant "food worry" thoughts.  It is knowing that your health and your value as a person do not change because you ate a food that you had labeled as "bad" or "fattening."  (2007)</p>
