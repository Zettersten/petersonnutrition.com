<h3>Class Light of the Moon Cafe:</h3>
<p><span class="fltrt"><img src="i/lomc-horiz_s_pnf.gif" alt="" width="248" height="96" class="img"/></span>Hello Folks,</p>
<p>I am excited to announce Light of the Moon Café&rsquo;, an online e-course/support circle for women seeking freedom from struggles with eating and weight issues.</p>
<p>It is a place that provides a <em>feast</em> of healing images and experiences that deepen our understanding of struggles with food, fat, and dieting—within the safety of an online women&rsquo;s support circle.<br />
  </p>
<p>Anita Johnston a psychologist/storyteller and I (a registered dietitian/group leader) have worked many years in the field of disordered eating. We are passionate about using women&rsquo;s circles for healing struggles with food, eating, and weight. </p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Light of the Moon Café</strong>&nbsp;has evolved from a collaboration of Anita&rsquo;s best selling book,&nbsp;<em>Eating in the Light of the Moon,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Soul Hunger</em>&nbsp;workshops that she has given around the country for years and from the popular&nbsp;<em>Eating in the Light of the Moon</em>&nbsp;support groups and <em>Wise Women</em> groups facilitated by myself. <br />
  </p>
<p>Anita and I spent years brainstorming how to bring the experience of diving deeper into the realm of nourishment for the soul—that so many women struggling with food, fat, and dieting seemed to hunger for—to a broader audience. We <em>fantasized </em>about how to create a venue to provide food for the soul in a way that would be easy, enjoyable, beautiful and enlightening. This eventually evolved into the concept of an online e-course and support group.</p>
<p> We <em>dreamed </em>about creating a space where a group of women of all ages from around the world could gather to be embraced in the warmth of a women&rsquo;s circle and have experiences that nourish the deepest, most intimate parts of their being. We <em>imagined</em> a &ldquo;place&rdquo; where women could show up in their own time without having to cancel important activities in their lives, where the night owls could commune with the early risers, where the introverts could find a venue for expression and the extroverts could find connection, where those on the path to recovery from disordered eating could meet and get encouragement from fellow travelers—and discover they were not alone.<br />
  And so we created a menu with something to be served up every day for the duration of the course, beginning with the &ldquo;Chef&rsquo;s Special&rdquo; for the week, a chapter assignment from <em>Eating in the Light of the Moon</em>.  We <em>concocted</em> tantalizing appetizers—bits of poetic inspiration—to keep participants focused, hopeful, and connected to what matters most.  For the main course, we provided an audio telling of a teaching story that Anita recorded with Emmy award-winning musician playing musical instruments from around the world.  We decided to follow this with downloadable &ldquo;story questions&rdquo; to help participants reflect further upon their thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and to savor the deeper meanings of the stories in a more personal, heartfelt way.</p>
<p>  For a bit of &ldquo;dinner theater&rdquo; at the Light of the Moon Café&rsquo;, we organized a series of short audio recordings, in which participants are invited to join us on a metaphoric journey into and out of the labyrinth of recovery (step by step, week by week). Then we concocted &ldquo;after dinner&rdquo; art and writing activities to enhance connections to our most authentic selves…so that insights could seep deep into the psyche and our soul could be nourished.  And of course, at the café&rsquo; there are delicious desserts—playlists of soothing, healing music and ways to create exquisite, sacred sanctuaries for R&amp;R, when feeling overwhelmed, depleted, and spiritually and emotionally hungry.<br />
  </p>
<p>If you want to deepen your understanding of your struggles with food and eating, and this feast of healing imagery and experiences appeals to you, go to <a href="http://www.lightofthemooncafe.com" target="_blank">www.lightofthemooncafe.com</a>.  We would love to have you join us there!</p>
<p>The first class starts January 5th and is filling quickly.  Because we like to keep it small and intimate, we have a limited number of spots available.</p>

<h3>Class on Intuitive Eating starting April 17, 2013:</h3>
<p>Hello Folks,</p>
<p>I will be offering a new 8 session class on <strong>Intuitive Eating </strong>starting April 17, 2013.</p>
<p>&quot;Intuitive eating is an approach that teaches you how to create a healthy relationship with your food, mind, and body—where you ultimately become the expert of your own body. You learn how to distinguish between physical and emotional feelings, and gain a sense of body wisdom. It's also a process of making peace with food—so that you no longer have constant &quot;food worry&quot; thoughts. It's knowing that your health and your worth as a person do not change, because you ate a food that you had labeled as &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;fattening.</p>
<p>The underlying premise of Intuitive Eating is that you will learn to respond to your inner body cues, because you were born with all the wisdom you need for eating intuitively. On the surface, this may sound simplistic, but it is rather complex. This inner wisdom is often clouded by years of dieting and food myths that abound in the culture. For example, &quot;Eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full&quot; may sound like basic common sense, but when you have a history of chronic dieting or of following rigid “healthy” rules about eating, it can be quite difficult. To be able to ultimately return to your inborn Intuitive Eater, a number of things need to be in place—most importantly, the ability to trust yourself!&quot;  Elyse Resch, MS RD FADA &amp; Evelyn Tribbole, MS RD</p>
<h4>The 10 Principals of Intuitive Eating</h4>
<ol>
  <li> Reject the Diet Mentality. </li>
  <li>Honor Your Hunger</li>
  <li>Make Peace with Food. </li>

  <li> Discover the Satisfaction Factor.</li>
  <li>Honor Your Feelings Without Using Food.</li>
  <li> Respect Your Body\</li>
  <li>Exercise--Feel the Difference. </li>
  <li>Honor Your Health--Gentle Nutrition.</li>
</ol>
<h4>8 Sessions~Wednesday Evenings<br />

              <h3>Pomegranates</h3>
              <p><span class="fltrt"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2230/2256201962_0eccf82165_n.jpg" alt="Pomegranate" class="img" /></span>The pomegranate is a nutritionally rich fruit with unique flavor and health-promoting characteristics. The round and typically red fruit grows on trees. Once opened, the interior is separated into compartments by thin, white, spongy, bitter tasting membranes. Each compartment contains sweet, juicy, berry-like fruit.</p>
              <p>Pomegranate juice contains a significant amount of vitamin A, C, E and K, as well as the minerals potassium and iron. It also contains small amounts of vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and foliate and the minerals copper, zinc, magnesium, calcium, selenium and phosphorus.</p>
              <p>Pomegranates are often called “super fruit” because Pomegranate juice also contains high levels of polyphenols, such as ellagic acid and punicalagin, which give it antioxidant properties therefore making them effective in reducing heart disease risk factors. It also contains phytosterols, which can help reduce cholesterol levels.</p>
              <p><span class="fltrt"><img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4137/4792554428_720297f7bd_n.jpg" alt="Pomegranate" class="img" /></span> </p><p>More about Pomegranates: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>It is rich source of soluble and insoluble dietary fibers, providing about 4 g per100 g (about 12% of RDA), which aid in smooth digestive and bowel movements.</li>
                <li>The fruit is a good source of antioxidant vitamin-C, provides about 17% per 100 g of daily requirement. Consumption of fruits rich in vitamin C help the body by boosting immunity.</li>
                <li>Regular consumption of pomegranate has also been found to be effective against prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), diabetes, lymphoma and to inhibit inflammation mechanisms involved in osteoarthritis.</li>
                <li>It is a rich source of soluble and insoluble dietary fibers, providing about 4 g per100 g (about 12% of RDA), which aid in smooth digestive and bowel movements. </li>
                <li>The fruit is moderate in calories; 100 g provides 83 calories and it is very low in Saturated Fat, Cholesterol and Sodium.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Now please don’t avoid eating a pomegranate because you don’t know how to eat them and for goodness sake don’t bite into it like an apple because it will be horribly bitter and you’ll be bitterly disappointed. Here is how you properly prepare a pomegranate:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Cut a half-inch or so off the crown. Be careful it will squirt. Pomegranate juice will stain everything.</li>
                <li>Score the skin of the fruit a couple of inches. It is not necessary to cut too deep, you are just trying to cut into the skin which is about 1/4in thick or so.</li>
                <li>Then put it face down in a bowl of cold water and leave it there for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Gently start to peel the skin away from the little pods, while holding the fruit underwater. Gently, brush all the juice pods off of the white membrane.</li>
                <li>The seeds sink and the membrane floats. Scoop out the membrane with a slotted spoon.</li>
                <li>Dump the juice pods in a strainer and rinse.</li>
                <li>Put in a bowl and chill. They taste the best when nice and cold.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Eat alone or add to salads or smoothies, juices, veggie dishes, soups, jellies, sorbets, yogurts, sauces or to flavor cakes and baked apples. Enjoy!</p>

            <h3>Hello Wise Women,</h3>
            <p>The Winter Solstice candlelit labyrinth walk will be held December 22nd from 4:30-6:30.  I will be walking the labyrinth at 5:30pm.  This will not be a Wise Women &quot;event,&quot; rather a silent, contemplative, personal journey inward.  If you would like to walk the labyrinth with other Wise women, join us at 5:30ish.  Feel free to bring family or friends; remember all are welcome here.</p>

            <h3> Gramma Zena's Green Beans</h3>
<p>Gramma Zena is my son's paternal grandmother and today is her birthday. She is Sicilian, Italian,  loves to cook, and, as you would expect,  cooks exquisite meals. I have great memories of the wonderful times I spent with her working in the kitchen creating delicious meals for her husband Ed, her daughter, six sons, all their spouses, oodles of grandchildren, her mother, father and sister. Whew!!</p>
<p>Here is a simple and delicious recipe from Gramma Zena:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 Vidalia Onion</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Garlic, pressed or chopped fine</li>
    <li>Marinara sauce, homemade preferred</li>
    <li>Green beans, fresh or frozen</li>
</ul>
<p>Saute onion in olive oil until translucent. Add garlic, stir and cook for a minute or two before adding a few spoonfuls of homemade or store bought Marinara sauce. In a separate container steam green beans. Stir the tomato-onion mixture over the green beans and serve.</p>
<p>This recipe is full of nutrients. The beans provide the carotenoids lutein &amp; beta carotene for healthy eyes, B-vitamins, antioxidants, and the mineral silicon for bone health and formation of connective tissue. The tomatoes provide abundant amounts of the antioxidant lycopene important for protection of our cells and DNA, and in reducing the risk of prostrate, breast and pancreatic cancers, especially when consumed with fats such as olive oil.</p>
<p>Mangia!</p>

            <h3>The Excitement of Cornrows in Anticipation of Summer</h3>
<p><span class="fltrt"><img src="i/rows-corn-spring.jpg" width="425" height="282" class="img" /></span>When I was a child I spent most of my summers on my Aunt and Uncle's farm just outside Lynchburg. While traveling to and from the farm my dad taught me to look for the early growth of corn rows planted perpendicular to the road. As I drive by the corn rows now, in adulthood, they are a harbinger of the fresh vegetables to be enjoyed throughout the summer months and I am reminded of the times when my Aunt and I would pick fresh vegetables from her garden for the evening meal. What excites you about spring?</p>

            <h3><img src="i/e.jpg" width="380" height="286" class="fltrt" />Reset Button &amp; Balance</h3>
<p>I have been teaching about balance for years now but like many I often times struggle to practice what I preach. Last year was a particularly busy year for me as my life was absorbed with emotional energy devoted to my extended family. Lately though, I have been working hard to balance my time by slowing down and kind of pressing the pause button.</p>
      <p>Over the summer I took advantage of several opportunities to go to the beach with my dear friend from middle school. I love the beach and feel completely rejuvenated when I dive into the salty waves and soak up the suns rays. I was also fortunate enough to be the invited guest of another friend on a trip to Philmont in New Mexico, where I hiked and for the first time went fly-fishing. I even caught four fish! Most recently, I completed a 15 yearlong goal of becoming certified as a scuba diver. There is something extremely fulfilling about being grounded in the grand outdoors. <img src="i/e2.jpg" width="380" height="286" class="fltrt" />The majesty of the mountains and power yet solace found in the rhythm of the ocean waves, the beauty in fields of wild flowers and experiencing a whole new world underwater makes me take pause. Those experiences truly reset my dial helping me to function effectively again, to feel more balanced and therefore more alive.</p>
      <p>Life affirming activities fill me up like nothing else. I envision the cartoon where the top half of my head is opened and a pitcher pours liquid life juice in until it runs over. That is how I feel when I experience the wonders of nature. That is how I felt scuba diving recently and being able to breathe underwater. I became a mermaid for a brief moment in time, free to move and breathe as my body felt called to do. I feel that way EVERYTIME I am outdoors swimming, hiking, kayaking, cycling etc.; connected and grounded deep into my core being. Have you thought about taking pause to reset?</p>

      <p><a href="contact.php">Join  us</a> for the next book discussion and activity group based on Anita’s Johnston’s book<em> Eating in the Light of the Moon. </em>This group is for any woman who is ready to transform their relationship with food.

                      <p>This past week provided me with many terrific opportunities for personal growth.  I was fortunate enough to host Anita Johnston, a friend and colleague, and accompany her while she interviewed Judith Duerk, a psychologist, musician, and author of <em><strong>Circle of Stones: Woman's Journey to Herself</strong></em> and<em> <strong>I Sit Listening to the Wind: Woman's Encounter Within Herself</strong></em> for a documentary film project.  I felt honored to witness these two powerful amazing women interact. </p>
            <p> How fortunate Richmond was to have Anita Johnston, psychologist, master story teller, lecturer, and renown author of <em><strong>Eating in the Light of the Moon: How Women Can Transform Their Relationship with Food Through Myths, Metaphors, and Storytelling</strong></em> present two workshops for people in and around the Richmond area.  “Eating Disorders Messengers of the Soul” was presented Friday to the professionals in our area and “Soul Hunger” to those coping with eating disorders on Saturday. </p>
            <p>Anita is a master story teller and her philosophy of using metaphors to help women discover and trust their inner wisdom, recognize what when their soul is starved and what it is hungry for is transformational, because I’ve witnessed friends and clients restore their relationship with themselves, with food, and with the world at large.  Anita’s approach provides a unique avenue to profound healing and brings that which is holding us back from healing to light.  Stay tuned, as I am sure she will be back to present more workshops in the near future! </p>
                      <p> If you are interested in future workshops <a href="contact.php">send me an email</a>  and I’ll add you to our mailing list.</p>
