<h4>Sophia's Success Story</h4>
<p>Hey Elisabeth, </p>
<p>I don't know if you remember me, but I came to see you in 2002 while I was an undergrad at UR. I was a&nbsp;friend of ______ (who worked with you for a while).&nbsp;I weighed 220 lbs and was miserable with my life. I was unhappy and NOT confident. I came to you for a while and lost about 25 lbs while I was your patient. I wanted to let you know that even though I no longer come see you, I have taken what you have taught me and I have run with it... literally!&nbsp; I ran the Monument 10K and am currently training for it again this year. I currently weigh 175 lbs and I continue to live a healthy lifestyle that SLOWLY drops weight and inches!!!! I am so much more confident. I go out on dates and don't have problems approaching guys anymore. I know it wasn't the weight that was preventing that, but the way I saw myself in general. </p>
<p>I'm a 2nd grade teacher now and I participate in recess and PE with the students regularly. The kids remind me to bring my sneakers :) I never want anyone to feel the way I felt when I was overweight. I incorporate nutrition lessons with my students and go through the lunch line with them to help them make good choices. They have learned that French fries are not vegetables :) </p>
<p>Anyway, I was going through some recipes in a cookbook of mine and found an old appointment card of yours.&nbsp;I thought I would let you know that even though I don't come to you anymore, you definitely made a difference in my life. You were so positive and real with me&nbsp;that it&nbsp;helped me realize that living healthy was not a lifetime of salads and baked chicken :) I work out 5-6 days a week doing&nbsp;both cardio and strength training. Sometimes I pick up big ole bags of dog food to remind myself of what is no longer on my body. I'm attaching a few pictures of how I look now so that you will hopefully remember me. :) </p>
<p>I hope things are well for you and your family and that you had a wonderful holiday. </p>
<p>Thanks again for everything,</p>
<p>--Sophia</p>
