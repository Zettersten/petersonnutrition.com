My weekly-ish individual sessions and weekly ELTM group sessions have changed my world. I was a 30 year bulimic. That started in college. Not really any big mental reasons for it - I come from a loving family and am a pretty &quot;buttoned up&quot; woman, wife, mother, daughter, friend, full time worker.... Lot on my plate so to speak.</em></p>
