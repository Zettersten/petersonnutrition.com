    <span class="fltrt"><img src="i/blog/2020/05/virtual-book-club.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" class="img"></span> I am thrilled to announce the next The Embody Book Club book title and invite you to join my amazing friend and colleague Laurie
    Manns, LPC, CSAC and me for a lively virtual conversation throughout the summer. This book is transformational. It will change you and challenge you and I am excited to share it with you! Invite a friend and come join us!
