</h4>

<p class="quote">
    <em>Those who struggle with disordered eating often find themselves in an unrelenting cycle of harsh self-judgment, painful emotions, and harmful behaviors. Seeing the body as an adversary, these patterns can lead many people to become withdrawn or isolated.
    Ann Biasetti’s powerful holistic approach to liberating people from disordered eating focuses on self-compassion and embodiment. This insight, informed by yoga and mindfulness meditation, views the body not just as something to be healed or restored
    but as a source of great wisdom and knowledge. Dr. Biasetti offers yoga-based movement, body-awareness practices, meditations, and journaling exercises to help release long-held habits of self-criticism and perfectionism. Her step-by-step program
    will rebuild self-compassion, self-care, body awareness, acceptance, and connection to the self and to others.</em> — Back cover of the book
