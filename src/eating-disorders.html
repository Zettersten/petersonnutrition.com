<h2> Peterson Nutrition and Fitness: Services</h2>
<h3>Specialties: Eating Disorders</h3>
<p>Many people <em>worry</em> about diet, nutrition, exercise, weight, and food! Elisabeth understands your concerns and knows how overwhelming they can be. She specializes in eating disorders and will work with you and the rest of your treatment team to help you heal your relationship with food. Congratulations for taking the important first step of reaching out for professional help.</p>
<p>Elisabeth Peterson has been an <a href="http://www.iaedp.com/">iaedp Certified Eating Disorders Registered Dietitian (CEDRD)</a> since 2011, is on the iaedp Certification Committee and has over 25 years experience working with eating disorders in both individual and group settings.</p>

<p>She is a trauma informed, anti-diet and weight-inclusive medical nutrition therapist supporting people in healing food and body image concerns.  She became a <a href="https://www.intuitiveeating.org/">Certified Intuitive Eating Counselor</a> in 2007 and aligns with the <a href="http://www.ellynsatterinstitute.org/">Ellyn Satter’s Eating Competence Model</a> and <a href="https://haescommunity.com/">Health at Every Size®</a> philosphy.  Elisabeth advocate of the non-diet approach to nutritional wellness, however some cases may, of necessity, begin with a structured approach. The work starts from a strength based empowerment perspective focused on what <em>is</em> working for you rather than what <em>is not</em> working for you and builds on the positives instead of dwelling on the negatives. Together, you and Elisabeth will work to re-build your self esteem in a compassionate, empathetic environment dedicated toward empowering you to move ever forward in pursuit of your goals. You will develop a healthy body image as you learn through mindful eating to eat healthy and love your body. </p>
<p>Healing an eating disorder requires:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identifying feelings and needs.</li>
	<li>Learning how to get your human needs met.</li>
	<li>Learning to tolerate uncomfortable feelings.</li>
	<li>Developing self care, self love and self respect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Elisabeth Peterson is a Certified Eating Disorders Registered Dietitian (CEDRD) with 23 years experience working  with eating disorders in both individual and group settings. She  will help you  by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Teaching you ways to change food, exercise and weight related behaviors.</li>
	<li>Teaching you about normal and abnormal food intake patterns, hunger patterns, metabolic rate and somatic sensations or symptoms of each. </li>
	<li>Increasing your awareness of physiological, biological and emotional body reactions to food, exercise and substance misuse.</li>
	<li>Assisting your understanding of connection between emotions and behaviors.</li>
	<li>Guiding you toward achieving a healthy relationship with food and develop normal eating patterns.</li>
	<li>Teaching you the benefits of an active lifestyle and encourage you to find activities that you enjoy.</li>
	<li>Keeping other members of the team apprised of changes in eating, weight and food behaviors. </li>
</ul>
<p>Weekly visits are recommended until clients have moved into the middle part of recovery. Treatment is individualized and together we will decide at what frequency you should schedule appointments.</p>
<p> A multidisciplinary approach is imperative for the treatment of eating disorders. Each client is encouraged to create a treatment team consisting of a Registered Dietitian, Psychotherapist (Individual and Family), Psychiatrist, Primary Care Physician (all who specialize in eating disorders) and parents (for minor clients) or significant others for support. </p>
