<h4>Mae's Success Story</h4>
<p align="left">&quot;How my life changed with a simple referral”</p>
<p align="left">In January of 2004, I went to see my GYN, Peter Zedler for a yearly check-up. I am a 46-year-old woman who has always struggled with obesity. Many years ago I gave up on dieting because it was frustrating, depriving, and just plain annoying. I had tried them all with slight success then I would fall back to the same bad habits. Year after year my weight kept increasing until it was clear that something had to be done. But I wanted to do it right once and for all. </p>
<p>I mentioned my concerns to Dr. Zedler and he immediately said, “I have just what you need”. He handed me a business card for Peterson Nutrition. He told me about his association with Elisabeth Peterson. He said that she could help me to find my way to the right eating habits. I took the card with optimism, but I was terrified.</p>
<p>I carried the card around for a few days before I got up the courage to call for an appointment. I remember being so nervous the morning of my first appointment. I just knew that I would never be able to eat anything good again, that I would never be able to socialize because of food restrictions and I would have to exercise like a marine recruit. Boy, was I wrong. </p>
<p>What I found was a caring, nurturing environment that worked with me to give me the freedom and options to eat what I liked and enough food so that I never felt hungry or deprived. I had no problems going out to restaurants and staying with the plan. As the weeks went by, my eating plan became a way of life for me as well as my family.</p>
<p>I go for monthly consultations now. Each month I learn eating and cooking tips that keep me from getting bored. I’m not afraid of food anymore. I even think that I eat more now than ever before, I just eat the right things. And exercise is even a fun part of my life. </p>
<p>I had concerns that a nutritionist would be very expensive. The fees are very reasonably and if you consider that I have added so much value to my life, they are an incredible bargain. I am so grateful to Elisabeth Peterson for helping me to change my life. This has been a wonderful experience for me and I am receiving great results in many ways.</p>
<p>--Mae</p>
