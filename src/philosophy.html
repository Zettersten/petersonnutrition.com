<h2>Relationship/Philosophy</h2>
<p><em>Your life is a sacred journey. And it is about change, growth, discovery, movement, transformation; continuously expanding your vision of what is possible, stretching your soul, learning to see clearly and deeply, listening to your intuition, taking courageous challenges at every step along the way. You are on the path… exactly where you are meant to be right now… And from here, you can only go forward, shaping your life story into a magnificent tale of triumph, of healing of courage, of beauty, of wisdom, of power, of dignity, and of love. —Caroline Adams</em></p>
<p>In reality, our life’s journey is remarkably similar to a labyrinth as we twist and turn the winding path to the center and back out again. The events and experiences, the joy, trials, pleasure and pain make up the mosaic of who we are. My personal mosaic is that of daughter, wife, mother, friend, and lover of life. I am passionate about life, and I am passionate about what I do as a registered dietitian/medical nutrition therapist.</p>
<p>We are all exactly where we are supposed to be on our individual paths. Moving forward begins with a single step and that next step forward is often intimidating and accompanied by a feeling of apprehension, which is normal. It should comfort you to know that we--you and I--will work TOGETHER as a team to get you on track toward your wellness goals. My goal for you is “healthy balance,” which is a component often missing in clients’ lives when they first come to me. My desire is to empower you with education and a listening ear as we pave the way for you toward a healthy relationship with food and body-mind-spirit balance.</p>
<p>I commend you for the steps you have taken to improve your health and overall well-being. I am here to help you navigate your way as you enhance your own mosaic through achieving your wellness goals.</p>
<p>Thank you for viewing my website. I invite you to peruse it and give me a call or <a href="contact.php">send me an email</a> if it feels right to you and you desire my support.</p>
<p>— Elisabeth</p>
