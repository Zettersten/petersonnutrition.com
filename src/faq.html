                    <h2> Peterson Nutrition and Fitness: FAQ</h2>
                    
                    <p class="question">What is the difference between a Registered Dietitian/Medical Nutrition Therapist and Nutritionist? </p><p class="answer1">Will the real expert please stand up? There is no standard definition for “nutritionist.”  A registered dietitian nutritionist or medical nutrition therapist is the nutrition authority in the community. S/he provides specific food and nutrition expertise to the health care team.  A registered dietitian minimally meets these criteria:  Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics approved bachelor’s degree, masters degree and post-graduate supervised clinical, community, food service and research experience, pass a national exam and maintain at least 75 hours of continuing education every five years.
Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) is a legal definition as only those who have passed the exam and maintain their continuing education are considered “registered.”  I am all three.</p>
                    
<p class="question">How long are your sessions? </p>
<p class="answer1">I offer 50 minute and 25 minute counseling sessions for individuals. I do conduct group sessions (couples, friends etc.) that require a longer time period; please call my office at <a href="tel:804-440-3110">804-440-3110</a> or email me at <a href="mailto:info@petersonnutrition.com">info@petersonnutrition.com</a> for details.<p class="answer2">
</p>

<p class="question">May we meet through telehealth?</p>
<p class="answer1">Yes, we can chat by telehealth, in person, or by phone.  I also offer online classes and groups.  Email us at <a href="mailto:info@petersonnutrition.com">info@petersonnutrition.com</a> or call our office at <a href="tel:804-440-3110">804-440-3110</a> to schedule.</p>

<p class="question">How do I schedule an appointment?</p><p class="answer1">To schedule, email us at <a href="mailto:info@petersonnutrition.com">info@petersonnutrition.com</a> or call our office at <a href="tel:804-440-3110">804-440-3110</a>.  Print, fill out, sign and email the "Client Information Form" found on <a href="contact.php">Contact page</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/shoppingcart?flowlogging_id=496fecd32c424&mfid=1590866184562_496fecd32c424">pay online</a> before the appointment.</p>

<p class="question">What if I need to cancel my appointment? </p>
<p class="answer1">A 24-hr notice is required for all cancellations.  This allows me to substitute another client in your scheduled slot.  If you must cancel last minute, we can conduct the session over the phone.  Appointments cancelled without a 24-hour notice and "no shows" are billed at the normal rate.  I am committed to helping you meet your wellness goals.  I expect your commitment in return. </p>


<p class="question">Do you take insurance? </p><p class="answer1">No.  Peterson Nutrition & Fitness is a fee-for service practice.  Some insurance companies cover nutritional counseling and some do not.  Call your insurance company and find out the scope of your coverage for your specific diagnosis. Oftentimes a referral from your doctor will be required.  I will provide a superbill, per your request, for you to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement.  Any reimbursement you receive, should you choose to submit the claim, will go directly to you.  I can also provide payment documentation for flex spending accounts, non custodial parents, etc.  Medicare does not cover my services and I am not a Medicare provider.  Therefore, clients cannot submit claims to Medicare for reimbursement of services rendered. 
</p>

<p class="question">Do you take credit/debit cards? </p>
<p class="answer1">Yes.  I accept <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/shoppingcart?flowlogging_id=496fecd32c424&mfid=1590866184562_496fecd32c424">payments</a> via cash, checks, credit/debit cards, Paypal, and Health Care Spending Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts (HSA/FSA) cards with a major credit card logo.</p>



<p class="question">May I bring my significant other or children to our sessions? </p><p class="answer1">Absolutely.  Individuals taking the path to wellness rely on companions for support. You may bring your children with you and they can quietly play with their toys while we chat.  If your child is the client, we will determine together if it would be best to meet first on their behalf or as a collective cohort.</p>

<p class="question">Do you provide personal training?</p><p class="answer1">I will design a program and guide you but currently do not offer one-on-one personal training service.  Peterson Nutrition & Fitness does not have an in-house training facility for training regimens.  Unfortunately most health clubs no longer allow personal trainers that are not affiliated with their club to train clients.</p>


<p class="question">I need more information, or would feel better talking with someone live, can I call you? </p><p class="answer1">Of course! Call me, leave a message with my office manager Shevaun Roukous.  I will return your call at my earliest convenience. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
