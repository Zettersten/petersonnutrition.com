From early childhood, I loved interacting with people. Whether it was at my grandmother’s, socializing with my extended family on her wraparound porch, at my Aunt Helen’s beauty shop which bustled with an array of characters prattling away, or with my friends, I always enjoyed listening and conversing and was eager to lend a helping hand.</p><p> I was very active in my youth and remain so to this day. I started swimming at the age of three and was a competitive synchronized swimmer into my teen years. I played varsity volleyball in high school, taught swimming lessons, was a lifeguard, coached swim teams and was active in community service. My main mode of transportation was by bicycle and our family always took advantage of what our surroundings offered by hiking, camping and backpacking. One of my fondest memories was backpacking in Yosemite with my girlfriend when I was fourteen. Carrying everything I needed on my back and sleeping under the stars with no tent was a life-affirming event.</p><p align="center"> &lt;&lt; Back &nbsp; Page 1 of 4 &nbsp; <a href="bio2-home-life.html">Next &gt;&gt;</a></p>
