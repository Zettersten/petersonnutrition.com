<h3>Group Counseling</h3>
<h4>Embody Book Club</h4>
<p>
“Connection is why we're here; it is what gives purpose and meaning to our
lives. The power that connection holds in our lives was confirmed when the
main concern about connection emerged as the fear of disconnection; the fear
that something we have done or failed to do, something about who we are or
where we come from, has made us unlovable and unworthy of connection..."</p>
<p>
“One of the greatest barriers to connection is the cultural importance we place
on ‘going it alone.’ Somehow we’ve come to equate success with not needing
anyone. Many of us are willing to extend a helping hand, but we’re very
reluctant to reach out for help when we need it ourselves. It’s as if we’ve divided
the world into ‘those who offer help’ and ‘those who need help.’ The truth is that
we are both.”—Brené Brown
</p>

<p>Be seen.</p>
<p>Be you.</p>
<p>Belong. —Brené Brown</p>

<p>Proven benefits of group work:</p>
<ul>
    <li>helps you realize your not alone</li>
    <li>facilitates giving and receiving support</li>
    <li>helps you find and practice using your “voice”</li>
    <li>helps you relae to others (and yourself) in healthier ways</li>
    <li>provides a safety net.</li>
</ul>


<p>We thrive by be feeding our spiritual, physical, intellectual, emotional and social
self.—why go it alone? Using fabulous books to guide our discussion, together we’ll
dive into and discuss topics that help us heal our relationship with our body, food
and soul.</p>

<p>The cost is $55/2hr session.</p>
