<h2> Peterson Nutrition and Fitness: Services</h2>
<h3>Testimonials: </h3>
<h4>Kaili's Success Story</h4>
<p>I’d like to take a moment to thank Elisabeth for the impact she has had on my life. I have had the opportunity to work with Elisabeth as both a parent and as a patient myself.</p>
<p>First, as a parent, it was spring; my daughter and I were at the Annual Cheerleading Sign ups for the upcoming fall season, a big deal for adolescent girls. When it came time to try on and order uniforms all the skirts they had as examples were too small for my daughter. We had to guess at a size and order a larger one. It was a very painful experience. I immediately made an appointment with Elisabeth. Elisabeth worked with both, my daughter and me throughout the summer, teaching and coaching us about healthy eating and making healthy choices. In the fall when cheerleading started the “larger” skirt literally fell off my daughter. What a happy day that was. Elisabeth’s caring support and guidance empowered us to make the changes necessary to our lifestyle. Thanks a million Elisabeth!</p>
<p>Secondly, as a patient, I have struggled with food related issues my entire life and have tried countless methods to make changes with none of them providing the results I was looking for. I would always optimistically make one step forward only to find myself two steps back and only more frustrated than when I started. Elisabeth’s unique combination of acknowledgment and insight coupled with her realistic style and approach has allowed me to progress and see things I have never seen before. Elisabeth is a key player on my “recovery team”. I have called on her numerous times to guide me and coach me on healthy eating choices and making healthy eating my lifestyle. She always gives me practical advice never trying to alter what I eat; always working with my own likes and dislikes. With Elisabeth’s support I’m proud to say that I am well on my way to finally finding peace with food.</p>
<p>In addition to my individual work with Elisabeth, I was a member of the first <em>Eating in the Light of the Moon</em> session in March 2008. WOW, it’s really hard to put into words how powerful that group was. It was my first “group” experience and yes I found myself out of my comfort zone a few times, but what an amazing growing opportunity that was. I continued on with the <em>Wise Women Group</em>, we have been meeting for a little over a year now. Elisabeth’s gentle spirit enables her to be a great facilitator. I can’t imagine my life without the members of that group; they are also a huge part of my recovery.</p>
<p>So, if you are anything like me and tired of searching for something that never seems to materialize I would strongly recommend you reaching out to Elisabeth and finally finding a way to achieve peace with food.</p>
<p>--Kaili</p>
