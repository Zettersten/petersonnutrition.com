                <h2><img src="i/swirl-l.gif" alt=" " width="300" height="300" align="right" />What is Intuitive Eating?</h2>
              <p><em>&quot;Intuitive eating is an approach that teaches you how to create a healthy relationship with your food, mind, and body—where you ultimately become the expert of your own body. You learn how to distinguish between physical and emotional feelings, and gain a sense of body wisdom. It's also a process of making peace with food—so that you no longer have constant &quot;food worry&quot; thoughts. It's knowing that your health and your worth as a person do not change, because you ate a food that you had labeled as &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;fattening.</em></p>
              <p><em>The underlying premise of Intuitive Eating is that you will learn to respond to your inner body cues, because you were born with all the wisdom you need for eating intuitively. On the surface, this may sound simplistic, but it is rather complex. This inner wisdom is often clouded by years of dieting and food myths that abound in the culture. For example, &quot;Eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full&quot; may sound like basic common sense, but when you have a history of chronic dieting or of following rigid “healthy” rules about eating, it can be quite difficult. To be able to ultimately return to your inborn Intuitive Eater, a number of things need to be in place—most importantly, the ability to trust yourself!</em>&quot;</p>
              <p>Elyse Resch, MS RD FADA &amp; Evelyn Tribbole, MS RD</p>
              <p>Elisabeth is a Registered Dietitian specializing in eating disorders and the dietetic needs of the community in general. She has used the Intuitive Eating approach in her practice for fifteen years. She attended the original Intuitive Eating Certification Conference in
California in 2007 and became certified by Elyse Resch, MS RD FADA and Evelyn Tribbole, MS RD. She is the only Certified Intuitive Eating Counselor in the Richmond, VA area. Elisabeth is a Registered Dietitian with the training and background to guide you though the Intuitive Eating principals while keeping you in balance with your personal medical history, family history, dieting history, prescription medicines, supplements, (drug-nutrient &amp; nutrient-nutrient interaction and absorption etc.), favorite foods and not so favorite foods and personal level of activity. She will simplify the complex chemistry that exists between food and metabolism and guide you toward a healthy relationship with food. Food should be pleasurable, delicious, have a wonderful aroma, texture and beautiful presentation while also being
                nutritious. Isn’t it time you made peace with it?</p>
              <h3><em>Here is a summary of the 10 principles of Intuitive Eating, from Resch &amp; Tribole’s book, Intuitive Eating, 2nd ed, 2003. With these principles, comes a world of satisfying eating and a sense of freedom that can be exhilarating! </em><em>Intuitive Eating Principles</em>:</h3>
              <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li><strong><span class="principle">Reject the Diet Mentality.</span></strong> Throw out the diet books and magazine articles that      offer you false hope of losing weight quickly, easily, and permanently.      Get angry at the lies that have led you to feel as if you were a failure      every time a new diet stopped working and you gained back all of the      weight. If you allow even one small hope to linger that a new and better      diet might be lurking around the corner, it will prevent you from being      free to rediscover Intuitive Eating.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="principle">Honor Your Hunger</span></strong>.      Keep your body biologically fed with adequate energy and carbohydrates.      Otherwise you can trigger a primal drive to overeat. Once you reach the      moment of excessive hunger, all intentions of moderate, conscious eating      are fleeting and irrelevant. Learning to honor this first biological      signal sets the stage for re-building trust with yourself and food.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="principle">Make Peace with Food.</span></strong> Call a truce, stop the food fight! Give yourself unconditional permission      to eat. If you tell yourself that you can't or shouldn't have a particular      food, it can lead to intense feelings of deprivation that build into      uncontrollable cravings and, often, bingeing When you finally “give-in” to      your forbidden food, eating will be experienced with such intensity, it      usually results in Last Supper overeating, and overwhelming guilt.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="principle">Challenge the Food      Police</span></strong>. Scream a loud &quot;NO&quot; to thoughts in your head      that declare you're &quot;good&quot; for eating under 1000 calories or      &quot;bad&quot; because you ate a piece of chocolate cake. The Food Police      monitor the unreasonable rules that dieting has created . The police      station is housed deep in your psyche, and its loud speaker shouts      negative barbs, hopeless phrases, and guilt-provoking indictments. Chasing      the Food Police away is a critical step in returning to Intuitive Eating.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="principle">Respect Your      Fullness.</span></strong> Listen for the body signals that tell you that you are      no longer hungry. Observe the signs that show that you're comfortably      full. Pause in the middle of a meal or food and ask yourself how the food      tastes, and what is your current fullness level?</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="principle">Discover the      Satisfaction Factor</span></strong>. The Japanese have the wisdom to promote      pleasure as one of their goals of healthy living In our fury to be thin      and healthy, we often overlook one of the most basic gifts of      existence--the pleasure and satisfaction that can be found in the eating      experience. When you eat what you really want, in an environment that is      inviting and conducive, the pleasure you derive will be a powerful force      in helping you feel satisfied and content. By providing this experience      for yourself, you will find that it takes much less food to decide you've      had &quot;enough&quot;.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="principle">Honor Your Feelings      Without Using Food</span></strong>. Find ways to comfort , nurture, distract, and      resolve your issues without using food. Anxiety, loneliness, boredom,      anger are emotions we all experience throughout life. Each has its own      trigger, and each has its own appeasement. Food won't fix any of these      feelings. It may comfort for the short term, distract from the pain, or      even numb you into a food hangover. But food won't solve the problem. If      anything, eating for an emotional hunger will only make you feel worse in      the long run. You'll ultimately have to deal with the source of the emotion,      as well as the discomfort of overeating.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="principle">Respect Your Body.</span></strong> Accept your genetic blueprint. Just as a person with a shoe size of eight      would not expect to realistically squeeze into a size six, it is equally      as futile (and uncomfortable) to have the same expectation with body size.      But mostly, respect your body, so you can feel better about who you are.      It's hard to reject the diet mentality if you are unrealistic and overly      critical about your body shape.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="principle">Exercise--Feel the      Difference. </span></strong>Forget militant exercise. Just get active and feel      the difference. Shift your focus to how it feels to move your body, rather      than the calorie burning effect of exercise. If you focus on how you feel      from working out, such as energized, it can make the difference between      rolling out of bed for a brisk morning walk or hitting the snooze alarm.      If when you wake up, your only goal is to lose weight, it's usually not a      motivating factor in that moment of time.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="principle">Honor Your      Health--Gentle Nutrition</span></strong>. Make food choices that honor your      health and taste buds while making you feel well. Remember that you don't      have to eat a perfect diet to be healthy. You will not suddenly get a      nutrient deficiency or gain weight from one snack, one meal, or one day of      eating. It's what you eat consistently over time that matters, progress      not perfection is what counts.</li>
